# Powershop New Zealand — Home Assistant Integration

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)
[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/PMKA/powershop-nz.svg)](https://github.com/PMKA/powershop-nz/releases)

A Home Assistant custom component for **Powershop New Zealand** customers. Monitor your account balance, electricity rates, usage, and Power Pack coverage — updated every 15 minutes.

## Features

- **Account Balance** — current balance in NZD
- **Time-of-Use Rates** — off-peak, peak, and shoulder rates in c/kWh
- **Usage Monitoring** — today's kWh and billing period kWh
- **Billing Gauges** — mirrors the Powershop app: used cost, estimated total, pack coverage %, and still-to-buy shortfall for the current period
- **Power Pack Tracking** — total redeemable pack balance and full pack list; upcoming 5 billing periods show estimated cost vs packs already purchased
- **Passwordless Auth** — uses Powershop's email OTP login (no password stored)
- **Automatic Token Refresh** — stays authenticated silently in the background
- **Regular Updates** — 15-minute refresh interval

## Requirements

- A Powershop NZ account at [app.powershop.nz](https://app.powershop.nz)
- Home Assistant 2024.1 or later
- HACS (for managed installation)

## Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations**
3. Click the three dots (⋮) in the top right corner → **Custom repositories**
4. Add `https://github.com/PMKA/powershop-nz` and select **Integration**
5. Click **Add**, then find **Powershop NZ** in the list and install it
6. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `custom_components/powershop/` folder into your HA config's `custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

Authentication uses a one-time password (OTP) sent to your email — no password required:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
2. Search for **Powershop**
3. Enter your Powershop account email address and click **Submit**
4. Check your email for the one-time code and enter it, then click **Submit**

Your account number and property ID are discovered automatically. Home Assistant will prompt you to re-authenticate if your session ever expires — just repeat the OTP process.

```yaml
- period_start: "2026-05-06"
  period_end: "2026-06-05"
  cost_estimated_nzd: 390.78     # projected cost based on your usage pattern
  voucher_bought_nzd: 0.00       # packs pre-purchased for that specific month
  cost_still_to_buy_nzd: 390.78  # shortfall
  coverage_pct: 0.0
```

**`sensor.powershop_voucher_balance`** includes a `vouchers` attribute listing every active pack with its name, available-from date, remaining balance, and original value.

## Troubleshooting

**No OTP email?** Check spam, make sure you're using the right address, and try again, i found at some times of day the emails were slow to come through.

This integration is **not officially affiliated** with Powershop. Use at your own risk, I just wanted to have my rate data available in HA, reached out to Powershop to ask for API access but was nothing available so built my own.
